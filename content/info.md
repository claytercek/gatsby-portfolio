I am an interactive developer and designer based in Philadelphia, specializing
in rich experiences in spaces both physical and digital. I have done work in
software development, mobile app creation, UX/UI, front-end/back-end web,
graphic design, 3D design, and audio engineering.

My focus is on creating experiences that surprise, excite, and inspire, whether
they be auditory or visual, virtual or physical. My favorite projects are those
that seem as if they’re plucked from science fiction, blending physical and
digital interaction to inform and entertain.
