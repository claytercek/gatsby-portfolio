Developed as an exercise to learn the basics of Svelte, sympathize is a tweet
sentiment analysis app. Type in any phrase, and Sympathize will analyze recent,
popular tweets containing that phrase, and show a visual depiction of the
overall sentiment (meaning how positive or negative those tweets are). The
deeper the blue, the more positive, and the deeper the red, the more negative.
