I built breezy in order to experiment with 3d in the web, and writing glsl
shaders. It is a static, mobile friendly scene that depicts a serene beach. It
includes a custom water shader that subtlely displaces everything below it to
give the effect of refraction under water, and it includes some custom animated
fish that were modeled, rigged, and animated in Cinema 4D and then exported as
point level animation, then imported into threejs.
