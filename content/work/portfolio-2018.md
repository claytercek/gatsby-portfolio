## Responsive portfolio website with a fun color scheme and unique interactions.

For my Content Management Systems class at Drexel I designed and developed this responsive theme for WordPress. I created it with these fun, loud ,and colorful shapes that appear throughout the site. All assets were developed from scratch, including the Ajax page transitions and SVG animations using Lottie.
