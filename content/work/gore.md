## Touchscreen experiences built for W. L. Gore & Associates' Capabilities Center, each communicating the development process and value of a different Gore product.

## Performance

The performance interactive is an array of touchscreen displays, each one taking
a deep dive into a W. L. Gore product to show off it's individual
characteristics and capabilities, with a hands-on demonstration to accompany it.
The six station's are all capable of showing four different types of data:

- slideshows with animated transitions
- high resolution videos
- hot-spots, which allow users to select points of interest and learn more
- scrubbers, essentially the same as the videos, though encouraging users to
  scrub back and forth

For ease of debugging, the six displays are all running the same cinder
application, though with station specific data being fed to them.

# Community & Culture

Community & Culture was another touchscreen interaction in the same space,
though with one 80-inch touchscreen, accompanied by three smaller square
auxiliary screens. This app showcased four videos that capture some of the
unique talents and perspectives of Gore employees.
