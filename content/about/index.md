I am a creative developer with several years of experience as a 3D designer, graphic designer, and audio technician.

My focus is on creating experiences that surprise, excite, and inspire, whether they be auditory, visual, virtual or physical. I want people to be transported by what I’ve built. My favorite projects have been those that seem as if they’re plucked from science fiction, blending physical and digital interfaces to amuse and entertain.

My work ranges from front-end development, interface design, illustration and graphic design to 3d animation, VR video production, video editing, and audio production. I essentially work within every digital medium.
